# Building for Windows (C only, MSVC)

This is a legacy build mode that excludes Go dependencies.

Note that it will also exclude a lot of new features implemented in the [main version](./build-windows.md).

For building with MinGW, see [this page](./build-windows-legacy-mingw.md).

## Building

_TODO: provide a clear guideline_

In the meantime, you could try building with [MinGW](./build-windows-legacy-mingw.md).
